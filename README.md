# About Me

Hello! I'm Brandon Mazate, a medical professional with a strong fascination for the intersection of medicine and data science. My journey has taken me from the world of aesthetic medicine and hair transplantation to the exciting realm of data-driven healthcare solutions.

## Passion for Data Science

My interest in data science stems from my belief that data has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. I'm deeply intrigued by the possibilities of leveraging data to improve patient outcomes, enhance medical research, and streamline healthcare processes.

## Embracing the Data-Driven Approach

I am committed to exploring the vast potential of data science to address complex healthcare challenges. While my medical background equips me with a unique perspective, my ongoing data science journey enables me to blend the art of medicine with the precision of data analysis.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for both medicine and data science. Whether you're a fellow healthcare enthusiast or a data science enthusiast, let's collaborate, share insights, and explore the exciting possibilities at the intersection of our interests.

Feel free to reach out to me at fernandomazate@gmail.com. Let's embark on this data-driven healthcare journey together!

## My projects

### Introduction to "Ten Year CHD Prediction" Project

[Ten Year CHD project](https://github.com/Fermazate/Heart-Disease-Prediction)

In my "Ten Year CHD Prediction" project, I developed models to predict the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in patients. The project encompassed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and data visualization, with an emphasis on addressing data imbalance through SMOTE analysis. Various predictive models were tested to evaluate their effectiveness. While the initial accuracy was moderate, this project sets the stage for my subsequent "Tuning Project," where I aim to refine and enhance model performance, showcasing the iterative nature and improvement potential in data science.
